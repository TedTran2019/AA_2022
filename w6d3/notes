ajax -> async js and xml
think soundcloud, gmail, etc
rails <-> ajax
browser already knows how to do this style of request all on its own
staying on same page, firing a JS callback on success (serialize deserialize)

callback hell -> promise -> async await (syntactic sugar for promises)
promises: then, reject, catch, finally, Promise.all
catch is just then(undefined, func)
https://web.dev/promises/
https://web.dev/async-functions/

jqXHR (jquery version of 'promise', a deferred). fail instead of catch

Routes can choose to default to json or whatever else instead of HTML.
