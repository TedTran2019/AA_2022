React Router: [Docs](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/docs/getting-started/installation.md#basic-installation)
[Usage Docs](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/tutorial)
BrowserRouter, Route and props. Path, exact, element vs render
wildcard segments
[Hooks](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks)
props: location, match info, history

raise/rescue vs throw/catch
module extend(class methods) vs include(instance methods)

link-> to, NavLink, Switch, withRouter, Redirect, advanced containers

util -> does the POST request
thunk action -> calls util, then dispatches actions (thru action creator) based on payload
action is used by reducer (pure function, returns next state and that's it)

dispatch returns whatever whatever the action/func it calls returns
.then -> whatever => whatever.payload.thing
async always returns a promise!
