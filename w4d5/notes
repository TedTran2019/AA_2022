Learn how to use Rails form_with and scaffolds, Github Copilot for tests
-----------------------
Rails testing -> works, refactor, collab, documentation
unit -> integration -> end to end (MVC)
factory_bot_rails / faker / rspec-rails / shoulda-matchers / capybara /launchy
extra: rails-controller-testing (if you want those depreciated methods), guard-rspec

rails g rspec:install
--require spec_helper, --color, --format documentation

What do you test on each of the MVC?
one liners for validations + associations
Using factory bot / faker / shoulda-matchers
rails rspec API for controller testing (C)
Capybara API for testing website features
rspec view specs 

# my_app/config/application.rb
config.generators do |g|
  g.test_framework :rspec,
    :fixtures => false,
    :view_specs => false,
    :helper_specs => false,
    :routing_specs => false,
    :controller_specs => true,
    :request_specs => false
end

rails db:reset RAILS_ENV=test
have_http_status(nbr) replaced be_success
be_present

Gems -> application.rb edit -> edit files for gems -> setup rspec and db
app controller/helper useful methods

Form_with is really amazing. The best part is that you can write HTML anytime. 
Includes auth_token, hidden method 'patch' which it prob. does thru checking persistance, etc
Values are retained without being specified. 

Concerns are great for DRYing up code
