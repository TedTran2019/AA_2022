Other frameworks

Tip: For single repo, -G flag so you don't have nested repositories
rails commnds: 
new -d=postgresql
db:create
generate migration ActionTableName
db:migrate, db:migrate:status
db:rollback (Don't do this)
console, dbconsole
db:schema:load

migrations, change > up/down
Active Record methods + validations
associations: has_many, belongs_to, has_many through, has_one through
has one, has_and_belongs_to_many (many-to-many) - Not used often

gems: annotate, pry-rails, byebug, better_errors, binding_of_caller

validations vs constraints. complementary! 

indexing (n vs logn since you can binary search once sorted),
usually always index foreign keys. Add index if it's something you'll use for
searching or joining

N + 1 query
