mimemagic gem issues -> Change ver. to 3.10. I orig. tried the latest version(0.4.3), 
bundle update mimemagic, then bundle update marcel.

Can use the same app helper file across diff. projects. Could save a lot of pain.

Project not allowing form_for, but it seems it'll be awesome in future projects.

Just playing around is showing me a lot.
- You'll run into small bugs if you don't surround erb values with ''...
- Review on N+1 queries and includes. Not gonna bother fixing for this toy project
- There are gems to detect, and it's pretty easy to see on your own as well
- 'false' and presence validations
- Flash works as intended, but Flash.now doesn't. Why not? Figured it out. After
an error, you have to put a status code with the render or it doesn't work.
