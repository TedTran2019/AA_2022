# AA_2022
Mega Repo of AA. I went through all of App Academy Open on my own to challenge myself and gain useful skills. 

A lot of the information was outdated, so I did a lot of projects twice; once doing it the old way and another using modern best practices. It's pretty cool to see the evolution of technology and I've gained a profound appreciation for the abstractions that allow programmers to solve problems much easier.
